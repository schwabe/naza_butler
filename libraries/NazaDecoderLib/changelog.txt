NazaDecoder library changelog
------------------------------
Version 20141130
  [FIX] added msgLen checking to protect against exceeding the message buffer (which could cause the decoder to stop working properly)
  [FIX] changed the name of the message buffer from gpsPayload to payload as it is not only GPS related (cosmetic change)

Version 20141109
  [NEW] added a define (ATTITUDE_SENSING_DISABLED) that allows disabling attitude (pitch/roll) sensing. This may be useful when you experience a conflict with another library that also uses the interrupt or on a board that does not support the interrupt used.
  [NEW] attitude sensing is by default disabled for Teensy boards
